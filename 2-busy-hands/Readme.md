###Special Notes

Notice the roll-overs - you've got to figure out how to change the image of the social 
media buttons when they're rolled over (hover). You will also have to figure out how the 
change the background of the header based on hover to get the "blue light" effect when the 
mouse is hovering over the header links.

###Suggested elements/ids/classes to include

These are some ideas for divs you might want to include in your page 
structure -- the names aren't super important (you can change them if 
you'd like), but might be helpful for indicating what each div does/where it goes.

``` 
#wrapper 
#container 

<header> 
<nav>

#main-content 
#social-media 

.photobanner 
.imageshadow

#blurb 

#home-boxes 
    .home-box
    .home-box
    .home-box

<footer> 
    .box-footer 
         .blogroll
    .box-footer 
         .textwidget 

#copyright 
#companybottom
```
